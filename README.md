# CMOS_SRAM-and-RCA_Layout-Sim
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project focuses on designing and verifying a 6T SRAM cell and a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder layout using Magic VLSI for layout design and IRSIM for simulation. The objective is to ensure that the design is DRC error-free and the functionally correctness. This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the design steps, layout process, verification, and simulation results.
